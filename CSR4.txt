3. Metadata

    To perform DTO to object mapping or reverse the DTO MUST define some metadata that inform any processor about how
the DTO or the object will be hydrated.

    3.1. Format
    
        The metadata SHOULD be specified in several formats, such as YAML, Annotations, XML or any other needed. To
    perform this the metadata MUST be a set of object properties metadata contained into an object metadata
    definition.

        3.1.1. Loaders
        
            The metadata parser MUST implements an interface that MAY be called 'MetadataFormatParser'.
            
            The metadata parser interface MUST define a loading method that MAY be called 'Parse($input)' that will
        parse the given input and return an object metadata.
    
        A parser MUST be used to transform the metadata from the initial format to the object metadata.
        
    3.2. Object metadata
    
        The object metadata MAY be called 'ObjectMetadata'.
        
        This object MUST implements an interface that MAY be called 'ObjectMetadataInterface'.
        
        The object metadata interface MUST extends IteratorInterface.
        
        The object metadata interface MUST define a set of method that give access to the contained metadata. By this 
    way :
        - MUST implement a method that allow to retreive all the object property metadata as array.
        - MUST implement a method that allow to retreive a specific object property metadata by it's target property
        name
    
    3.3. Object property metadata
    
        The object property metadata MAY be called 'ObjectPropertyMetadata'.
        
        This object MUST implements an interface that MAY be called 'ObjectPropertyMetadataInterface'.
        
        This object MUST implements a method that allow to retreive it's target property name.
        
        This object MUST implements any methods needed by the section 4.
